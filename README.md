# ENGO551_Lab5
This is a simple interactive web application that uses Leaflet.js and Turf.js that generates a simplified version of a user-drawn polyline on a map with the click of a button. Users also have the option to erase polylines from the map to start a new drawing. 

The video demo for this project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/tDfiBhITPog)

This website was built with HTML and Javascript. The following tools, libraries and plugins were used in development:
- **[Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)** for creating the interactive map.
- **[Leaflet.draw](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/docs/leaflet-draw-0.4.9.html)** for providing drawing functionality on the leaflet map
- **[Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/)** for generating the simplified polyline drawn by the user
- **[Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)** to create the grid layout of the HTML page and styles for user input

## Project Files
**map.html** - HTML file defining the layout of the site and functionality for user inputs. Also contains all the JavaScript code providing map functionality and user interactivity for this module.
